# Project description
CPM is a cross-platform build system that aim for solving C++ building complexity,
such as ease of use and dependency management.

# Motivation
C++ is the very first language I have learned in the past. On that time it is not a productive language.
So I switched to C# and Go and working on them for a while (around 3 and 1 years). In the meantime
I also checking on C++11 and found out it is a big improvement for C++ but still no anything like
NuGet or Go tools. That why I started this project.

# Goal
* Lightweight, easy to use and cross-platform.
* The only dependency is C++14 and platform API.
* Supports multiple toolchains and full control of it.
* Easy to manage dependencies.
* Multiple build's configurations.
 
# Naming
CPM is stand for C++ Project Manager.
